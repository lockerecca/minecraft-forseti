# Welcome to the configuration! It can be hard to configure the plugin correctly, but once you do, hackers will feel the heat.
#
# The most important values are the Threshhold and Safe Hit Decreasing values.
# The others are mostly just customization and tweaks.
# 
# Increasing these values makes detection slower, but will definitely fix false positives.
#
# Decreasing catches clients more effectively and faster - But watch out for catching legitimate players!
#
# Threshhold/SafeHitDecrease options are:
# 
# Threshhold and SafeHitDecrease (for MobInFront).
# HeadValue (for HeadPlayer). HeadPlayer doesn't need a Safe Hit Decrease option.
# DetectThreshhold (for normal check). This doesn't have a "Decrease" system.
# Threshhold and LowerAmount (for AntiKnockback).
#
# If you get a false positive (or not detecting) for any of these features, increase or lower their Threshhold/SafeHit variables.
#
# The way that AntiAura works is that IT HAS FALSE POSITIVES. That is why there is the threshhold system!
# In other words, as long as hackers get MORE "false positives" than non-hacking players, you won't get any false kicks !
# The default configuration is USUALLY fine. But a lot can be modified to improve hack detection or squash bugs.
#
Important:
  #To fix tab flickering...
  FixTabFlickering:
    #This pre-spawns mobs to be used. How many do you want spawned?
    #This means that this amount of mobs will ALWAYS be spawned alongside EVERY player!
    #If your server is lagging due to a high ticking of EntitySquid, LOWER THIS!
    MobAmount: 30
Forcefield:
  MobInFront:
    #Enabling this will enable the old detecton behaviour, which will catch AutoClicker and Macros much better.
    #If you enable this, you may need higher SafeHitDecrease values. *Technically* it MAY detect forcefield faster.
    OldBehaviour: false
    #Currently the plugin checks every hit when the check is intiated.
    #Do you want to only check one hit in every check?
    #May make detection faster for some clients, and slower for others. You may need to experiment with this.
    OneHitPerCheck: false
    #Do you want to enable the mob in front?
    #This will create a squid between the player and the person who he is attacking.
    #If the player still hits the person (with the squid in the way), he is hacking.
    Enable: true

    #Every time a person hits the player (when the squid is spawned), the number goes up by 1.
    #Every time a person hits the squid (when the squid is spawned), the number goes down by your SafeHitDecrease value in the config.
    #If the number hits this value, the person is detected for hacking (and MobBypassCommand is executed).
    Threshhold: 10
    #As described above, how much should Threshhold go down by on a non-hacking hit?
    SafeHitDecrease: 4.5

    #Lower this to 15 if your Threshhold is at 10 and people are still kicked!
    TimeSpawned: 20
    #The nearer the player is to the player he is hitting, the more likely false-positives are to occur.
    #The plugin will not do the MobInFront check if the player is closer than MinDistance blocks to the other player.
    #You can decrease it if you are having issues with not detecting. A minimum value of 1 may be acceptable.
    MinDistance: 1.5

  ForcefieldCommand: kick %PLAYER% Forcefield is not allowed!#broadcast %PLAYER% was kicked for hacking! (Normal)

  #Rules as to how the number goes up/down are the same ones explained on the MobInFront threshhold value.

  #Lowering this SIGNIFICANTLY decreases the lag per check of each player.

  Threshhold: 5
  #How much do you want to lower the threshhold when a player is detected as legit?
  #If hacked clients have a higher detect rate than normal people, it may be a good idea to set a low Difference and a high LowerAmount.
  #With the above suggestion, legit players would be detected more but kept below the threshholds, wheras hacked clients who were detected more would get kicked.
